Steps in enabling TDE in a database named TDE_Demo

1. Set a master key within the master database using the CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION command.

USE master;
GO

CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'Pa55.w.rd';
GO

2. Create a certificate in the master database, which will be used for the encryption using the CREATE CERTIFICATE command.

CREATE CERTIFICATE MyServerCert
    WITH SUBJECT = 'TDEDemo_Certificate';
GO

3. Create a database encryption key within the database, which allows you to enable TDE with the CREATE DATABASE ENCRYPTION KEY command.

USE [TDE_Demo];
GO

CREATE DATABASE ENCRYPTION KEY
    WITH ALGORITHM = AES_256 ENCRYPTION BY SERVER CERTIFICATE MyServerCert;
GO

4. Once the encryption key is created, it needs to be enabled using the ALTER DATABASE command.

ALTER DATABASE TDE_Demo SET ENCRYPTION ON;
GO
