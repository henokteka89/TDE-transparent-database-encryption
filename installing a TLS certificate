installing a TLS certificate

Configure SQL Server instance
You can configure a SQL Server instance to use encrypted connections by following these steps:

1. On the SQL Server Configuration Manager, expand SQL Server Network Configuration, right-click Protocols for <server instance>, and then select Properties.

2. From the Protocols for <server instance> Properties dialog box, select the Certificate tab, then select the certificate from the Certificate drop-down.
 
3. On the Flags tab, in the ForceEncryption property, select Yes, and then click OK.

 4. Restart the SQL Server service.

 
All steps must have been executed correctly for you to be able to authenticate through SQL Server Management Studio using TLS.

If the correct access is not provided, restarting SQL Server service will fail.
